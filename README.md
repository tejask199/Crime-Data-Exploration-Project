# Crime-Data-Exploration-Project
SQL- Python Project

##overview 

This project aims to explore and visualize crime data to uncover patterns, trends, and hotspots in various neighborhoods. 
By analyzing spatial patterns, victim demographics, location-specific occurrences, and crime code data, the project seeks
to provide data-driven insights to help enhance community safety and reduce crime rates.




##Objectives
1.Identify crime hotspots and spatial distribution patterns.

2.Understand demographic trends among victims. 

3.Analyze location-specific occurrences and types of crimes.

4.Use findings to support data-driven decision-making for community safety initiatives.





##Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns related to crime incidents:

DR_NO: Unique identifier for each crime report.

Date_Rptd: The date when the crime was reported.

DATE_OCC: The date when the crime actually occurred.

AREA_NAME: The name of the area where the crime took place.

Crm_Cd: Code categorizing the type of crime.

Crm_Cd_Desc: Description of the specific crime.

Vict_Age: Age of the victim.

Vict_Sex: Gender of the victim.

Premis_Desc: Description of the premises where the crime occurred.

Status: Status of the crime case (e.g., open, closed).

Location: General location of the incident.

LAT: Latitude coordinate of the crime’s location.

LON: Longitude coordinate of the crime’s location.



##Technologies Used
SQL: Data extraction and transformation

Python: Data analysis and visualization

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, pymysql
